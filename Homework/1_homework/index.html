    <div>
        <h2>Ha Long Bay - Vietnam</h2>
        <img src="images/vietnam.jpg" alt="" width="500px">
        <p>The extraordinary Ha Long Bay is located in the far north of Vietnam, near
            <br> the border to China. You may know this impressive landscape from the
            <br> famous James Bond movie "Tomorrow never dies." We recommend: rent a boat
            <br> and swim in the turquoise blue sea, an indescribable experience!</p>
            <br>
        <h2>The Colosseum - Italy</h2>
        <img src="images/italy.jpg" alt="" width="500px">
        <p>You can visit countless attractions in the Italian capital, Rome, but do not
            <br> miss the opportunity to visit the unique Colosseum. The huge arena
            <br> hosted the gladiatorial battles of the ruling Emperor. An exciting
            <br> experience!</p>
            <br>
        <h2>The Amazon rainforest - South America</h2>
        <img src="images/south_america.jpg" alt="" width="500px">
        <p>Deep green and full of life: these are the key facts of the Amazon rainforest.
            <br> There is probably no other jungle in the world that is so impressive.
            <br> For good reason, the Amazon is also called "the green lung of the earth".
            <br> Wander through the jungle to the most extraordinary places.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>The pyramids of Giza - Egypt</h2>
        <img src="images/egypt.jpg" alt="" width="500px">
        <p>If there is a historic place in the world to visit, then it is Egypt! Such as
            <br> the unparalleled history of the pharaohs, the huge pyramids in the
            <br> desert and the towering capital of Cairo. We recommend that you do not
            <br> miss all this during your holiday in Egypt. The famous Pyramids of Giza,
            <br> which consist of a total of 6 pieces, are among the oldest buildings in
            <br> the world. You will be enchanted!</p>
            <br>
        <h2>Taj Mohal - India</h2>
        <img src="images/india.jpg" alt="" width="500px">
        <p>The Taj Mahal is probably the most glamorous tomb in the world and the most
            <br> visited attraction in India. We also know why, because this place is more
            <br> than impressive! The symmetrical white marble building stands out from
            <br> the azure blue sky. If you are in India, a visit to the city of Agra
            <br> is a must.</p>
