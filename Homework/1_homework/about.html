        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I AM 21 YEARS OLD AND LIVE NEAR LIMBAÅ½I. I GRADUATED FROM
            <br> VALMIERAS TECHNICAL SCHOOL WITH A SPECIALIZATION
            <br> IN COOKING. HOWEVER, I HAVE COME TO REALIZE THAT THIS
            <br> KIND OF JOB IS NOT FOR ME. HOPEFULLY, IN NEAR FUTURE, I WILL BE
            <br> ABLE TO WORK IN THE IT INDUSTRY.</p>
